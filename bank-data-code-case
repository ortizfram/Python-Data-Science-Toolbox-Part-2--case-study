#Dictionaries for data science
"""Create a zip object by calling zip() and passing to it feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result to zipped_lists.
Create a dictionary from the zipped_lists zip object by calling dict() with zipped_lists. Assign the resulting dictionary to rs_dict."""

# Zip lists: zipped_lists
zipped_lists = zip(feature_names, row_vals)

# Create a dictionary: rs_dict
rs_dict = dict(zipped_lists)

# Print the dictionary
print(rs_dict)

#Writing a function to help you
"""In this exercise, you will create a function to house the code you wrote earlier to make things easier and much more concise. Why? This way, you only need to call the function and supply the appropriate lists to create your dictionaries! Again, the lists feature_names and row_vals are preloaded and these contain the header names of the dataset and actual values of a row from the dataset, respectively.

Instructions
100 XP
Define the function lists2dict() with two parameters: first is list1 and second is list2.
Return the resulting dictionary rs_dict in lists2dict().
Call the lists2dict() function with the arguments feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result of the function call to rs_fxn."""
