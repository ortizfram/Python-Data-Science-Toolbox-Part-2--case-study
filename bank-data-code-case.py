#Writing a function to help you
"""In this exercise, you will create a function to house the code you wrote earlier to make things easier and much more concise. Why? This way, you only need to call the function and supply the appropriate lists to create your dictionaries! Again, the lists feature_names and row_vals are preloaded and these contain the header names of the dataset and actual values of a row from the dataset, respectively.

Define the function lists2dict() with two parameters: first is list1 and second is list2.
Return the resulting dictionary rs_dict in lists2dict().
Call the lists2dict() function with the arguments feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result of the function call to rs_fxn."""

#Using a list comprehension
"""
This time, you're going to use the lists2dict() function you defined in the last exercise to turn a bunch of lists into a list of dictionaries with the help of a list comprehension.

The lists2dict() function has already been preloaded, together with a couple of lists, feature_names and row_lists. feature_names contains the header names of the World Bank dataset and row_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist is a list of actual values of a row from the dataset.

Your goal is to use a list comprehension to generate a list of dicts, where the keys are the header names and the values are the row entries.

--Instructions

Inspect the contents of row_lists by printing the first two lists in row_lists.
Create a list comprehension that generates a dictionary using lists2dict() for each sublist in row_lists. The keys are from the feature_names list and the values are the row entries in row_lists. Use sublist as your iterator variable and assign the resulting list of dictionaries to list_of_dicts.
Look at the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts by printing them out."""

# Print the first two lists in row_lists
print(row_lists[0])
print(row_lists[1])

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Print the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts
print(list_of_dicts[0])
print(list_of_dicts[1])

#Turning this all into a DataFrame
"""You've zipped lists together, created a function to house your code, and even used the function in a list comprehension to generate a list of dictionaries. That was a lot of work and you did a great job!

You will now use all of these to convert the list of dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame. You will see how convenient it is to generate a DataFrame from dictionaries with the DataFrame() function from the pandas package.

The lists2dict() function, feature_names list, and row_lists list have been preloaded for this exercise.

Go for it!

--Instructions

To use the DataFrame() function you need, first import the pandas package with the alias pd.
Create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries in list_of_dicts by calling pd.DataFrame(). Assign the resulting DataFrame to df.
Inspect the contents of df printing the head of the DataFrame. Head of the DataFrame df can be accessed by calling df.head()."""
# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Turn list of dicts into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(list_of_dicts)

# Print the head of the DataFrame
